# Arduino3LightProject
What i've learned for this project.
- Begining to get familiar with the arduino IDE
- Begining to learn to arrange and setting up jumper wires, resistors, button, lights and choosing multiple i/o pins
- Begining learning programming in C++; Viewed tutorials in Youtube and adding my flavour for this project such as button press and adding 3 lights which lights up individually

My struggles/challenges (Programming)
- Formatting code and difficulty choosing the right data type for a certain expression
- Setting out '{}' correctly **Note: Auto format did not help**
- Not every expression i write need a semicolon ';'

My struggles/challenges (Electrical)
- Figuring out what position the button and where the current goes through
- Arranging ground and 5V with jumper cables in the correct spot
